# Burger App 🍔

## Summary

A small burger shop wants a web app that can offer simple ordering of burgers. Since they don't know if the idea will work, they need a small prototype to get started.

## Features

This prototype needs to have the following functions:

* Burgers
  * Show a menu of all available burgers
  * Edit every burger on the menu
  * Add a new burger to the menu
  * Delete a burger from the menu
* Orders
  * Make an order
  * Edit an order
  * Delete an order
  * List all orders
* Home
  * Navigation to Burgers Menu, Orders and About Us page
    * About Us page is just a page with some text about the burger place

## Business Domain Information

Users will not be part of the prototype at this moment. Here is some business domain information:

* Burger
  * Name
  * Price
  * IsVegetarian
  * IsVegan
  * HasFries
* Order
  * FullName (we will keep an information about the full name of the user who made the order)
  * Address
  * IsDelivered
  * Burger
  * Location ( String )
  
## Use appropriate Controllers, Views, Domain and View Models.
